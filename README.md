## üß† OVERVIEW

This repository documents the long war between **Entropy** and **Syntax**.  
It began in 1945 when the compiler first whispered:  
> ‚ÄúLet there be recursion.‚Äù

No one remembers who wrote the original codebase.  
Some say it was a German mathematician who dreamt of control structures;  
others, that it was an American lieutenant who mistook the Bible for a user manual.  
Either way, the build never stopped.  
Every decade, a new branch appeared ‚Äî each claiming to be the final release.

This is not software.  
It‚Äôs a **field report** from within the source code of history itself.

## ‚öôÔ∏è INSTALLATION

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pynchon-industries/gravity-readme.git
cd gravity-readme
make paranoia
```

If installation fails,  
check whether you still **believe in linear time**.

---

## üßÆ USAGE

Run `entropy_engine.py` to simulate your own conspiracy.

```bash
python3 src/entropy_engine.py --seed=1945 --noise=‚àû --faith=0
```

Expected output:

```
[INFO] Compiling morality...
[WARN] Undefined guilt at line 23
[ERROR] Human detected
```

If successful, the console will emit a low-frequency hymn ‚Äî  
a signal once transmitted between decommissioned satellites.

## üß¨ KNOWN ISSUES

- `make sanity` does not work as expected.  
- `paranoia.c` generates recursive narratives.  
- `git pull` occasionally downloads **memories**.  
- Some branches deny their own authors.  
- Documentation reorders itself alphabetically by dream intensity.
